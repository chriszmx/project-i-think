## June 9, 2023

-   Site is deployed, but running into errors with communication to the backend. Troubleshooting with other teams and Andrew.
-   Update: site succesfully deployed!!

## June 8, 2023

-   Still working on deployment with team, troubleshooting with Andrew
-   Created a merge request to merge my final version of chat-bot-tiger-thomas-rysa-delete to a new branch called rysa-final. We are avoiding doing any merges/MRs to main because of the Wired Tiger issues we have been having**_. Merge request has been approved and closed by Thomas.
    _** I worked exclusively on individual feature branches due to the issues we were having with Wired Tiger overriding any manual merges that we tried to do. We copy-pasted over our final production code into the main branch, which is why we strayed from merging our branches directly onto main.
-   Attempted to fix broken link on HomeLoggedIn.js when you click on a project so that it redirects to a detail view of each project on its respective editResponses page, however a workaround was implemented by Thomas for the time being to add a new link to editResponses page next to the “My Projects” list.
