# Main.py

This is a FastAPI server that includes routers for various endpoints and middleware for handling CORS requests.

## Usage

To run the server, execute the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can access the various endpoints by navigating to the appropriate URL. For example, to access the `accounts` endpoint, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8000/accounts`.

## Endpoints

The server includes the following endpoints:

- `/auth` - handles authentication and generates JWT tokens
- `/accounts` - handles CRUD operations for user accounts
- `/ai` - handles AI-related operations
- `/projects` - handles CRUD operations for AI projects
- `/image` - handles image-related operations

Each endpoint is defined in a separate router module located in the `routers` directory.

## Middleware

The server includes a middleware function for handling CORS requests. This middleware allows requests from the following origins:

- http://localhost
- http://localhost:8000
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:27017

In addition to the CORS middleware, the server includes a middleware function for adding CORS headers to responses.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.x and the following packages to run:

- fastapi
- uvicorn

You can install these packages using the following command:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

# Authenticator.py

This module defines a custom `Authenticator` class for handling authentication and authorization in a FastAPI application.

## Usage

To use the `MyAuthenticator` class in your application, you can create an instance of the class with your signing key and use it as a dependency in your FastAPI endpoints.

For example, to protect an endpoint with authentication, you can use the `Authenticator` instance as a dependency like this:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from authenticator import MyAuthenticator
from queries.accounts import AccountQueries

app = FastAPI()
authenticator = MyAuthenticator("my-signing-key")

@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(
    account: AccountOut = Depends(authenticator.get_current_account),
):
    # Only authenticated users can access this route
    return {"message": f"Hello, {account.email}!"}
```

In this example, the `protected_route` endpoint is protected by the `Authenticator` instance. The `get_current_account` method of the `MyAuthenticator` class is used as a dependency to retrieve the current user's account data.

## Dependencies

The `MyAuthenticator` class depends on the `AccountQueries` class from the `queries.accounts` module to retrieve account data from the database. This dependency is injected into the `MyAuthenticator` class using the `Depends` function from the `fastapi` module.

## Methods

The `MyAuthenticator` class defines several methods for handling authentication and authorization:

- `get_account_data`: retrieves account data from the database based on the user's email address
- `get_account_getter`: returns the `AccountQueries` instance for use as a dependency in FastAPI endpoints
- `get_hashed_password`: retrieves the hashed password value from an `AccountOut` object
- `get_account_data_for_cookie`: retrieves the user's email and account data for use in a JWT cookie

## Configuration

The `MyAuthenticator` class requires a signing key to be passed in as a parameter when creating an instance of the class. This key should be stored in an environment variable for security purposes, as shown in the example code:

```python
import os
from authenticator import MyAuthenticator

authenticator = MyAuthenticator(os.environ["SIGNING_KEY"])
```

## Requirements

This module requires Python 3.x and the following packages to run:

- fastapi
- jwtdown-fastapi

----------





















## Getting started

You have a project repository, now what? The next section
lists all of the deliverables that are due at the end of the
week. Below is some guidance for getting started on the
tasks for this week.

## Install Extensions

- Prettier: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode>
- Black Formatter: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter>

## Deliverables

- [ ] Wire-frame diagrams
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Project is deployed to Caprover (BE, DB) & GitLab-pages (FE)
- [ ] GitLab issue board is setup and in use (or project management tool of choice)
- [ ] Journals

## Project layout

The layout of the project is just like all of the projects
you did with `docker-compose` in module #2. You will create
a directory in the root of the repository for each service
that you add to your project just like those previous
projects were setup.

### Directories

Several directories have been added to your project. The
directories `docs` and `journals` are places for you and
your team-mates to, respectively, put any documentation
about your project that you create and to put your
project-journal entries. See the _README.md_ file in each
directory for more info.

The other directories, `ghi` and `sample_service`, are
sample services, that you can start building off of or use
as a reference point.

Inside of `ghi` is a minimal React app that has an "under
construction" page. It is setup similarly to all of the
other React projects that you have worked on.

Inside of `sample_service` is a minimal FastAPI application.
"Where are all the files?" you might ask? Well, the
`main.py` file is the whole thing, and go take look inside
of it... There's not even much in there..., hmm? That is
FastAPI, we'll learn more about it in the coming days. Can
you figure out what this little web-application does even
though you haven't learned about FastAPI yet?

Also in `sample_service` is a directory for your migrations.
If you choose to use PostgreSQL, then you'll want to use
migrations to control your database. Unlike Django, where
migrations were automatically created for you, you'll write
yours by hand using DDL. Don't worry about not knowing what
DDL means; we have you covered. There's a sample migration
in there that creates two tables so you can see what they
look like.

The sample Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev run your migrations
for you automatically.

### Other files

The following project files have been created as a minimal
starting point. Please follow the guidance for each one for
a most successful project.

- `docker-compose.yaml`: there isn't much in here, just a
  **really** simple UI and FastAPI service. Add services
  (like a database) to this file as you did with previous
  projects in module #2.
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: This is your "ci/cd" file where you will
  configure automated unit tests, code quality checks, and
  the building and deployment of your production system.
  Currently, all it does is deploy an "under construction"
  page to your production UI on GitLab and a sample backend
  to CapRover. We will learn much more about this file.
- `.gitignore`: This is a file that prevents unwanted files
  from getting added to your repository, files like
  `pyc` files, `__pycache__`, etc. We've set it up so that
  it has a good default configuration for Python projects.
- `.env.sample`: This file is a template to copy when
  creating environment variables for your team. Create a
  copy called `.env` and put your own passwords in here
  without fear of it being committed to git (see `.env`
  listed in `.gitignore`). You can also put team related
  environment variables in here, things like api and signing
  keys that shouldn't be committed; these should be
  duplicated in your deployed environments.

## How to complete the initial deploy

There will be further guidance on completing the initial
deployment, but it just consists of these steps:

### Setup GitLab repo/project

- make sure this project is in a group. If it isn't, stop
  now and move it to a GitLab group
- remove the fork relationship: In GitLab go to:

  Settings -> General -> Advanced -> Remove fork relationship

- add these GitLab CI/CD variables:
  - PUBLIC_URL : this is your gitlab pages URL
  - SAMPLE_SERVICE_API_HOST: enter "blank" for now

#### Your GitLab pages URL

You can't find this in GitLab until after you've done a deploy
but you can figure it out yourself from your GitLab project URL.

If this is your project URL

https://gitlab.com/GROUP_NAME/PROJECT_NAME

then your GitLab pages URL will be

https://GROUP_NAME.gitlab.io/PROJECT_NAME

### Initialize CapRover

1. Attain IP address and domain from an instructor
1. Follow the steps in the CD Cookbook in Learn.

### Update GitLab CI/CD variables

Copy the service URL for your CapRover service and then paste
that into the value for the SAMPLE_SERVICE_API_HOST CI/CD variable
